# Hacker News Clone Project

### What is it?
This application is a clone of the popular news aggregator site called Hacker News (created by Y Combinator). Users can create article blog posts for others to browse through, add their favorite posts to a favorites tab, or delete older/expired posts of their own.

### Tech Stack
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to design the front end due to the ease of implementation. I implemented a Hack-or-Snooze API created by our course instruction team to store user data and handle requests from the client.

### Challenges and Roadblocks
One of the biggest challenges I faced was implementing an API into the project. It was difficult to understand all the GET and POST requests being made and which piece connected to which, but I was eventually able to figure it out by drawing out a roadmap.
